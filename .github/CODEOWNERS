# This file is a list of the people responsible for ensuring that patches for a
# particular part of SourceKit-LSP are reviewed, either by themselves or by
# someone else. They are also the gatekeepers for their part of Swift, with the
# final word on what goes in or not.

# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.

# Owner of anything in SourceKit-LSP not owned by anyone else.
