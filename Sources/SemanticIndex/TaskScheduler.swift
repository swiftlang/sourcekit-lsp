  ///  1. Not add any `TaskDependencyAction` for a currently executing task. This means that the two tasks can run in
  ///     parallel.
  ///  2. Declare a `waitAndElevatePriorityOfDependency` dependency. This will prevent execution of this task until
  ///     the other task has finished executing. It will elevate the priority of the dependency to the same priority as
  ///     this task. This ensures that we don't get into a priority inversion problem where a high-priority task is
  ///     waiting for a low-priority task.
  ///  3. Declare a `cancelAndRescheduleDependency`. If the task dependency is idempotent and has a priority that's not
  ///     higher than the this task's priority, this causes the task dependency to be cancelled, so that this task can
  ///     execute. The canceled task will be scheduled to re-run at a later point.
  ///     - Declaring a `cancelAndRescheduleDependency` dependency on a task that is not idempotent will change the
  ///       dependency to a `waitAndElevatePriorityOfDependency` dependency and log a fault.
  ///       A `cancelAndRescheduleDependency` dependency should never be emitted for a task that's not idempotent.
  ///     - If the task that should be canceled and re-scheduled has a higher priority than this task, the
  ///       `waitAndElevatePriorityOfDependency` dependency is changed to a `waitAndElevatePriorityOfDependency`
  ///       dependency. This is done to ensure that low-priority tasks can't interfere with the execution of

///    preparation task is running at a time without enforcing any order in which the preparation tasks should run.
///  - It allows the maximum number of tasks to be limited at a given priority. This allows us to eg. only use half the
///    computer's cores for background indexing and using all cores if user interaction is depending on a set of files
///    being indexed without over-subscribing the CPU.
///  - It allows tasks to be canceled and rescheduled to make room for tasks that are faster to execute. For example,
///    this is used when we have a joint background index task for file `A`, `B` and `C` (which might be in the same
///    target) with low priority. We now request to index `A` with high priority separately because it's needed for user
///    interaction. This cancels the joint indexing of `A`, `B` and `C` so that `A` can be indexed as a standalone file
///    as quickly as possible. The joint indexing of `A`, `B` and `C` is then re-scheduled (again at low priority) and
